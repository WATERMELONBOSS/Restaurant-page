# 🍽️ Namma Thindi (Mock) – Virtual South Indian Breakfast Restaurant

This repository contains the **mock version** of the official **Namma Thindi** website developed during my internship at **Contriver**.  
It showcases a virtual South Indian breakfast experience with modern web aesthetics, responsive design, and cultural richness.

> ✅ This version was built as a front-end prototype to demonstrate design ideas, image placement, and responsive layout for the final production-ready site delivered to the client.
